    "The main goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to make it easier to create and manage software\n",
    "by organizing it like real-world objects and their interactions.\n",
    "It does this by using objects and classes to group data and actions together, promoting code\n",

    "\n",
    "an object is a fundamental concept used to represent and manipulate data.\n",

    "Objects are instances of classes, which are like blueprints that define the structure and behavior\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, you can have objects representing numbers, strings, lists, and even more complex custom\n",
    "objects that you define in your code.\n",

    "Modifying Instance Attributes: You can use self to modify the values of instance variables.\n",

    "Calling Other Instance Methods: You can call other instance methods within a class using self.\n",
